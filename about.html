                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">
                    I am an active-duty US Navy servicemember with a solid foundation in electrical, technical, and
                    security systems. Having recently completed my
                    Associate of Applied Science (AAS) in Information Technology at Del Mar College, I have shifted my
                    career focus toward becoming a Software Developer or Linux System
                    Administrator. My mission is to apply the skills Iâ€™ve gained in the Navy, my academic studies, and
                    my ongoing technical education to create secure,
                    innovative solutions that meet the demands of modern IT environments while continually advancing my
                    expertise in technology.

                <h3>Key Experiences</h3>
                <p>
                    During my time in the Navy, I developed a diverse technical background. I spent five years working
                    in Visual Landing Aids (VLA), where I managed systems
                    like the Integrated Launch and Recovery Television Surveillance System (ILARTS) and the Improved
                    Fresnel Lens Optical Landing System (IFLOLS). My role in
                    this capacity focused heavily on information and communication technologies essential for aviation
                    support. Additionally, I spent a year in armed security,
                    where I ensured the safety and security of critical Navy facilities. Currently, I work in the
                    security department of a Navy clinic, where I maintain and monitor
                    Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), guaranteeing the operational integrity and compliance of these
                    critical systems.

                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">
                    Over the years, I have earned several industry-recognized certifications that highlight my
                    dedication to IT and cybersecurity. These include foundational
                    certifications like CompTIA ITF+, as well as more advanced credentials such as CompTIA A+, Network+,
                    Linux+, Security+, and Cloud+. Additionally, I achieved
                    the C/C++ Institute Certified C Programmer certification, which demonstrates my proficiency in
                    low-level programming and software development principles.

                <h3>Completed Bootcamps</h3>
                <p class="d-none d-sm-block">
                    To further expand my technical knowledge, I completed several intensive bootcamps. These include
                    Nucamp's Web Development Fundamentals, Full Stack + Mobile
                    Development, and Back End, SQL, and DevOps with Python programs. I also completed the Vertex Game
                    Development Program, where I honed my skills in game
                    development and interactive technologies, including work with Unreal Engine 5. These experiences
                    have significantly enhanced my understanding of software
                    development and modern IT practices.

                <p>
                    My technical skillset includes a strong grasp of programming languages such as HTML5, CSS,
                    JavaScript, Python, and C/C++. I am experienced in working with
                    frameworks and tools like Node.js, React, and Bootstrap, which have allowed me to develop both web
                    applications and user-friendly interfaces. Additionally,
                    my familiarity with Unreal Engine 5 has given me valuable insights into creating complex interactive
                    environments and advanced visual projects. These skills
                    reflect my ability to adapt to various technologies and tools to meet the demands of dynamic IT
                    roles.
